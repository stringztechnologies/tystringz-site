<h1>Why I Build AI by Day and Make Afrobeats by Night</h1>
<div class="article-meta">February 2026 · 6 min read</div>

<p>People love a clean narrative. They want you to be one thing. "What do you do?" is supposed to have a simple answer. I'm an AI Software Engineer at Microsoft. I'm also an Afrobeats artist. A multi-instrumentalist. A Grammy Academy voting member. A self-producing musician whose debut single charted #2 on iTunes Worldwide. When I tell people all of this, they look at me like I'm glitching. Like the system can't process someone being both.</p>

<p>But here's the thing — for me, there is no "both." There's just one brain doing what it loves in different mediums. Code is creative. Music is logical. The line between them is thinner than anyone thinks.</p>

<h2>A Typical Day</h2>

<p>Let me walk you through a Tuesday. I wake up at 6:30. Check Slack, check email, check if anything broke overnight. By 9 AM, I'm in standup with my team at Microsoft, discussing AI model performance, data pipelines, deployment strategies. This isn't a side gig or a hobby job — I'm building systems that process millions of data points, that learn patterns, that make decisions. It's intellectually demanding in a way that I find deeply satisfying.</p>

<p>By 6 PM, I'm in my home studio. Same brain, different output. I'm layering a guitar riff over an Amapiano beat. I'm tweaking the EQ on a vocal take. I'm writing lyrics in a mix of English, Yoruba, and Pidgin. The transition feels natural because both activities use the same core skills: pattern recognition, problem-solving, creative iteration, and the willingness to delete something that's not working and start over.</p>

<h2>How Code Thinks Like Music</h2>

<p>Software engineering is fundamentally about patterns. You're looking at data, identifying structures, building systems that recognize and respond to those structures. Music production is the exact same thing. A chord progression is a pattern. A drum rhythm is a loop — literally, in most DAWs. Song structure — verse, chorus, bridge — is an algorithm. When I'm writing code, I think in patterns. When I'm writing music, I think in patterns. The language changes, but the cognition doesn't.</p>

<p>There's a concept in AI called "transfer learning" — where a model trained on one task can apply its knowledge to a different but related task. That's literally what I do every day. The analytical rigor I bring to engineering makes my production cleaner, more intentional. The creative intuition I bring to music makes my code more elegant, more human. They feed each other.</p>

<blockquote>Code is creative. Music is logical. The line between them is thinner than anyone thinks.</blockquote>

<h2>The AI Perspective on Music</h2>

<p>Working in AI has given me a unique perspective on what makes music work. When you spend your days building systems that process human language, that recognize emotions in text, that predict what someone wants to hear — you start thinking about music differently. Not as magic, but as a sophisticated system of emotional triggers.</p>

<p>Why does a minor key sound sad? It's not arbitrary — there are frequency relationships that our brains are wired to interpret certain ways. Why do we find certain rhythms irresistible? There's neuroscience behind it — specific BPM ranges that sync with our heartbeat and movement patterns. Understanding this doesn't make the music less magical. It makes it more intentional. I can make deliberate choices about tempo, key, rhythm, and arrangement because I understand the science underneath the art.</p>

<p>I'm not saying I run my songs through an AI model before releasing them. That's not the point. The point is that thinking computationally — thinking about systems, feedback loops, optimization — makes me a more thoughtful producer. Every element in a TyStringz track is there for a reason. Nothing is accidental.</p>

<h2>The Identity Question</h2>

<p>The music industry doesn't know what to do with me. I've had meetings where people visibly short-circuit when I explain my background. "So you're a tech guy who makes music?" No. "So you're a musician who happens to work in tech?" Also no. I'm both. Fully. Not halfway in each world — all the way in both.</p>

<p>This used to bother me. I felt like I needed to hide the tech career to be taken seriously as an artist, or downplay the music to be taken seriously as an engineer. I stopped doing that. The dual identity is the brand. It's what makes TyStringz different from every other Afrobeats artist. There are plenty of talented musicians out there. There aren't many who are also building AI systems at one of the largest tech companies in the world.</p>

<h2>For the Others Like Me</h2>

<p>I know I'm not alone. There are thousands of people working in tech who have creative passions they've suppressed because the culture tells them to pick a lane. Engineers who paint. Data scientists who write poetry. Product managers who produce beats after the kids go to sleep. I see you. And I'm here to tell you that you don't have to choose.</p>

<p>The Renaissance ideal — the polymath, the person who excels across disciplines — isn't dead. It's just been rebranded as "unfocused" by a culture obsessed with specialization. But the most interesting people I know are the ones who refuse to be one thing. The best code I've written has been informed by musical thinking. The best music I've made has been informed by computational thinking. They're not competing priorities — they're compound interest.</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>I'm exploring the intersection more directly. I won't say too much yet, but there are projects in development that bring AI and music production closer together — not in the "AI-generated music" way that everyone's afraid of, but in ways that use AI as a tool to enhance human creativity. Think of it like how a synthesizer didn't replace musicians — it gave them new sounds. AI can do the same thing, if we let it.</p>

<p>"Pepper Body" with Skales just dropped. "Shalaye" charted #2 worldwide. The catalog is growing. The code is shipping. And I'm not slowing down on either front. Because the question was never "tech or music?" The answer was always "yes."</p>
