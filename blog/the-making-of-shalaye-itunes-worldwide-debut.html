<h1>The Making of Shalaye — A #2 iTunes Worldwide Debut</h1>
<div class="article-meta">2024 · 5 min read</div>

<p>I didn't expect "Shalaye" to chart. I know that sounds like false humility, but I genuinely didn't. When you're an independent artist based in Austin, Texas, you don't wake up thinking your debut single is going to hit #2 on iTunes Worldwide. You think about whether your mix sounds good, whether the artwork is right, whether anyone outside your group chat will press play. The chart thing? That wasn't in the plan.</p>

<p>But here's what I've learned: sometimes the songs that come easiest hit the hardest. "Shalaye" was one of those songs. It came together in a single session — four hours from the first chord to the final vocal take. That almost never happens. Most of my songs go through weeks of revision, re-recording, second-guessing. "Shalaye" was different. It wanted to exist.</p>

<h2>What "Shalaye" Means</h2>

<p>"Shalaye" is Yoruba. It means "to explain" or "to clarify." In Nigerian slang, it's taken on a bigger meaning — it's about being called to account, about having to justify yourself. "Come and shalaye" means "explain yourself." I loved the duality of it — it's playful, it's confrontational, it's romantic, it's defiant. All at once.</p>

<p>The song is about that moment in a relationship where someone wants answers. Where the vibes were good, but now there's tension, and someone needs to explain what's going on. We've all been there. That 2 AM conversation where you're trying to decode what someone actually means versus what they're saying. "Shalaye" is that conversation set to music.</p>

<h2>The Production</h2>

<p>I started with the guitar. A simple, clean-tone riff — almost like a question being asked over and over. I layered light percussion underneath, keeping it minimal. I didn't want to overwhelm the vocal. The hook had this natural bounce to it, and I let the production serve the melody instead of competing with it.</p>

<p>The bridge is my favorite part of the song. It drops down to almost nothing — just my voice and a single chord — before building back up. That breath of space is intentional. In Afrobeats production, there's sometimes a tendency to keep everything at 10 the whole time. I like creating dynamics. I like earning the climax by giving you a valley first.</p>

<p>I played every instrument on the track. Guitar, keys, bass — all programmed and performed by me. The drums are a hybrid of live percussion I recorded and electronic patterns. Mixing live and digital is kind of my signature at this point. It gives the music a warmth that pure electronic production can't replicate, while keeping the energy and precision that live-only recording sometimes lacks.</p>

<blockquote>Sometimes the songs that come easiest hit the hardest. "Shalaye" wanted to exist.</blockquote>

<h2>The Music Video</h2>

<p>We shot the "Shalaye" video with a vision that matched the song — intimate but cinematic. Warm colors, close-up shots, natural lighting. I didn't want a big production with fifty extras and a rented mansion. I wanted it to feel like a window into a real moment. The video tells the story of the song visually — the tension, the attraction, the unresolved questions. We kept the edit tight and let the performance carry the weight.</p>

<h2>The iTunes Moment</h2>

<p>Release day was quiet. I put the song out, posted on socials, and went to work. Literally — I had meetings at Microsoft that morning. I checked my phone during lunch and the numbers were already surprising. By evening, people were sending me screenshots. "#2 on iTunes Worldwide." I had to verify it myself because I thought someone was messing with me.</p>

<p>What made it special was that it wasn't driven by a major label push or a massive influencer campaign. It was organic. People heard the song, connected with it, and bought it. In an era of streaming, people were actually purchasing "Shalaye" on iTunes. That tells you something about the emotional connection the song created. You don't buy music you feel lukewarm about. You buy music that moves you.</p>

<h2>What It Changed</h2>

<p>"Shalaye" changed my relationship with my own music. Before it charted, I was an artist with potential. After, I was an artist with proof. There's a difference. The potential gets you in the room. The proof keeps you there. Industry conversations changed. Playlist curators who hadn't responded to previous submissions started reaching out. Features became easier to land. Not because I suddenly became more talented — the talent was always there — but because the numbers gave people permission to take a chance.</p>

<p>It also taught me not to overthink. The songs I've labored over for months haven't always been the ones that connected. And this one — this four-hour miracle — became my calling card. There's a lesson in that. Sometimes the art knows more than the artist. Your job is to get out of the way and let it happen.</p>

<p>A debut single charting #2 on iTunes Worldwide. From Surulere to the world chart. From a bedroom producer to a charting artist. "Shalaye" was the beginning of everything that came after — "Dawa," "Pepper Body," SXSW, all of it traces back to that one session where a song decided it wanted to exist, and I was smart enough to let it.</p>
