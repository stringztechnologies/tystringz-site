<h1>SXSW 2024 — TyStringz Live Performance Recap</h1>
<div class="article-meta">March 2024 · 5 min read</div>

<p>I've been going to SXSW since I moved to Austin. Every March, the city transforms. The population doubles. Every bar, every rooftop, every parking lot becomes a venue. You can't walk down Sixth Street without hearing three different genres bleeding into each other. For years, I was in the crowd. In 2024, I was on the stage.</p>

<p>Being a featured artist at SXSW is different from just playing a show. It's not like booking a gig at a local bar. SXSW is a global stage — industry people, press, fans, curious strangers who wandered in because they heard something they liked. The stakes feel higher because you know that one performance could change everything. Or nothing. Both are possible, and you have to be okay with both.</p>

<h2>The Week Before</h2>

<p>I won't lie — the week before was intense. I was still working my day job at Microsoft. I had sprint reviews, code reviews, the usual. Then I'd come home and rehearse for three hours. I was running on adrenaline and Nigerian jollof rice. My apartment looked like a bomb went off — cables everywhere, set lists taped to the wall, clothes options spread across every surface. I probably tried on fifteen outfits. Ended up wearing the first one I'd picked.</p>

<p>I put together a setlist that told a story. Not just a random collection of songs, but a journey — starting introspective with "Hurt," building through "Rora" and "Far Away," hitting the peak with "Shalaye," and closing with the unreleased material that would eventually become part of the next project. I wanted people to leave knowing who TyStringz was, not just what TyStringz sounded like.</p>

<h2>Sound Check Reality</h2>

<p>Sound check was humbling. The venue was bigger than anywhere I'd performed before. The monitors were different. The acoustics were different. I had about twenty minutes to figure it all out. This is where being a multi-instrumentalist and self-producer actually helps — I understand sound systems from the technical side. I know what frequencies to cut, where the feedback is coming from, how to adjust my vocal delivery for the room. Most artists rely entirely on the sound engineer. I'm having a conversation with them in their language.</p>

<p>We got it dialed in. The bass was warm, the vocals were clear, the backing tracks sat right in the pocket. I remember standing on that empty stage during sound check, looking at the empty room, and imagining it full. It was a moment. A quiet one, but it mattered.</p>

<h2>The Performance</h2>

<p>The room filled up faster than I expected. And it wasn't just Afrobeats fans — it was the SXSW crowd, which means tech people, indie rock fans, country music journalists, hip-hop heads, people who didn't know what Afrobeats was. That's the beauty and the terror of SXSW. Your audience hasn't self-selected. They didn't buy tickets because they already love you. You have to win them.</p>

<p>I opened with "Hurt" — just me and the piano intro. The room got quiet. That's the moment you know you have them. Not when they cheer, but when they go silent. When they stop talking to their friends and turn to face the stage. That silence is more valuable than any applause.</p>

<p>By the time we hit "Rora," the energy shifted. People were moving. Phones were out — but not in the "I'm bored let me check Instagram" way. In the "I need to record this" way. The transition into "Shalaye" was the peak. I could feel the bass in my chest, the crowd was singing the hook back to me, and for about four minutes, nothing else existed. Not Microsoft. Not code. Not deadlines. Just the music and the people and the moment.</p>

<blockquote>The room got quiet. That's the moment you know you have them. Not when they cheer, but when they go silent.</blockquote>

<h2>Austin as Home</h2>

<p>Performing at SXSW in Austin felt like a homecoming, even though Lagos is my first home. Austin adopted me. The city's music scene is incredibly supportive — people show up for each other. I had friends in the audience who'd been with me since open mic nights at small bars on the East Side. Seeing their faces while I played on a SXSW stage was emotional in a way I didn't expect.</p>

<p>Austin's music scene doesn't get enough credit for its diversity. People think of it as a country and indie rock town, and it is those things. But there's also a growing Afrobeats and Afropop community here. Nigerian restaurants, African dance nights, a whole diaspora community that's building something. SXSW 2024 felt like a statement: we're here, and our music belongs on this stage too.</p>

<h2>What I Learned</h2>

<p>SXSW taught me that preparation matters, but presence matters more. You can rehearse a set a hundred times, but if you're not fully there in the moment — feeling the room, reading the energy, adjusting in real-time — it won't land. The best moments of my set were the unplanned ones. An extended guitar solo because the crowd was vibing. A call-and-response that wasn't in the set list. Those moments can't be rehearsed.</p>

<p>It also taught me that my dual identity — tech and music — isn't a handicap. It's a superpower. After the show, I had conversations with people from Google, Apple, Spotify, all saying they connected with the story because they saw themselves in it. People who code by day and create by night. People who contain multitudes and are tired of being put in one box.</p>

<p>SXSW 2024 wasn't the beginning, and it won't be the end. But it was a marker — a moment I can point to and say: that's when it started to feel real.</p>
