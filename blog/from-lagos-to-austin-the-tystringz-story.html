<article>

<p class="drop-cap">I was born in Lagos, Nigeria — Surulere, to be specific. If you know Lagos, you know Surulere is the heartbeat. Fela's shrine wasn't far. Music was in the water, in the air, in the way people talked. My earliest memories are sonic — the call to prayer at dawn, the generators humming at night, my mother's gospel cassettes competing with the neighbor's juju records. There was never silence. Lagos doesn't do silence.</p>

<p>I picked up my first instrument at seven. Piano. My parents were the classic Nigerian "you will be excellent at something" type, so they put me in lessons. But here's the thing — I actually loved it. I didn't have to be forced. I'd stay at the keyboard until someone dragged me away. By the time I was twelve, I was playing piano, guitar, drums, bass, saxophone, and violin. Six instruments before I was old enough to drive.</p>

<h2>The Dual Life Begins</h2>

<p>My parents were supportive of music, but they were also Nigerian. Which means: "Get a degree first." So I did. I studied computer science. Not because I was running away from music, but because I genuinely loved building things. Code fascinated me the same way chord progressions did — patterns, logic, creativity within constraints. The parallels between programming and music production are deeper than most people realize.</p>

<p>I moved to Austin, Texas for school and never left. Austin has this energy — it's a music city, but not in the obvious Nashville or LA way. It's weirder. It's more experimental. The "Keep Austin Weird" thing is real. For someone who was already straddling two worlds — tech and music, Nigeria and America — Austin felt like the one place where being uncategorizable was actually an asset.</p>

<p>Every ballot I fill out, I think about the next version of me somewhere in Lagos, hoping the system has space for them.</p>

<h2>Microsoft and AI</h2>

<p>I work as an AI Software Engineer at Microsoft. Full-time. Real job. Real deadlines. Real standups at 9 AM. People always ask me how I balance both — like I have some secret productivity hack or I don't sleep. The truth is simpler: I don't see them as separate. My brain doesn't have a "work mode" and a "music mode." It's all creation. At Microsoft, I build AI systems that understand patterns in data. In my studio, I build sonic systems that create patterns in emotion. Same muscle, different output.</p>

<p>The AI work actually makes me a better producer. When you spend your days thinking about how machines learn and process information, you start thinking about how humans process sound differently. What makes a melody memorable? Why does a certain rhythm make you move? These aren't just musical questions — they're cognitive science questions. And I sit at the intersection.</p>

<h2>Grammy Academy</h2>

<p>Becoming a Grammy Academy voting member was surreal. Not because of the prestige — though that's real — but because of what it represented. Here's a kid from Surulere who taught himself production in his bedroom, now sitting in the same rooms as people who shaped the music he grew up on. I don't take that lightly. Every ballot I fill out, I think about the next version of me somewhere in Lagos or Accra or Nairobi, hoping the system has space for them.</p>

<h2>The Sound</h2>

<p>People call my music Afrobeats, and that's accurate. But it's not the whole picture. I grew up on Fela, obviously. But I also grew up on Sade, Seal, Phil Collins, Boyz II Men. My guitar playing was shaped by John Mayer and Nile Rodgers. My production approach borrows from Timbaland and Pharrell as much as it does from any Afrobeats producer. When I sit down to make a track, I'm not thinking "let me make an Afrobeats song." I'm thinking "let me make a TyStringz song."</p>

<p>I self-produce almost everything. Not because I'm a control freak — okay, maybe a little — but because the production is the writing for me. I don't write lyrics and then hand them to a producer. I build the beat and the melody and the lyrics simultaneously. They grow together like roots of the same tree. When you hear a TyStringz song, every element was touched by the same hands.</p>

<h2>The Austin Scene</h2>

<p>Austin gave me something Lagos couldn't: anonymity. In Lagos, everyone knows everyone. The music scene is tight, and there's a template. Here in Austin, nobody expected me to sound a certain way. I could experiment. I could fail. I could put out a song that was half Afrobeats, half indie rock, and nobody would say I was betraying my roots. That freedom is priceless for an artist.</p>

<p>SXSW 2024 was a milestone — performing at one of the world's biggest music festivals, in my adopted hometown, playing music rooted in my original home. That full-circle moment hit me on stage. I looked out at a crowd of people from every corner of the world, moving to music born in Lagos, and I thought: this is what I was supposed to do.</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>I just dropped "Pepper Body" with Skales. My debut single "Shalaye" hit #2 on the iTunes Worldwide chart. The catalog is growing — "Dawa," "Jara," "Rora," "Far Away," each one a different shade of who I am. I'm not in a rush. The tech career taught me patience. You don't ship code before it's ready, and you don't ship music before it's honest.</p>

<p>Lagos to Austin. Six instruments to six-figure code. Grammy ballots and GitHub commits. I am all of these things at once, and I've stopped apologizing for it.</p>
