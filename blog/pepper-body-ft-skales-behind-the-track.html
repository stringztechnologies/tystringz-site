<h1>Pepper Body ft. Skales — Behind the Track</h1>
<div class="article-meta">February 13, 2026 · 5 min read</div>

<p>There's this feeling when you know a song is bigger than you. Like it doesn't belong to you anymore — it belongs to whoever needs it. That's what happened with "Pepper Body." I wrote the hook on a random Tuesday night in my apartment in Austin, just messing around with this Amapiano-influenced bounce I'd been sitting on for weeks. The melody came first, like it always does with me. I hummed it into my phone at 2 AM and forgot about it.</p>

<p>Two weeks later I pulled it back up, and it hit different. I built the full production that same night — layered the percussion, added those synth stabs, laid down the bass. By morning I had a demo that made my neighbors bang on the wall. I knew I needed another voice on it. Someone who understood the assignment.</p>

<h2>The Skales Connection</h2>

<p>If you know Afrobeats, you know Skales. The man has 53 million streams on "Shake Body" alone. He's done campaigns with Adidas. He has over 23,000 playlist placements. But beyond the numbers — Skales is a musician's musician. He understands groove. He understands pocket. When I reached out, I didn't pitch him a business opportunity. I sent him the demo and said, "Bro, this needs your energy."</p>

<p>He sent his verse back in three days. No notes. No revisions. He just… got it. His delivery on the second verse is exactly what I heard in my head but couldn't articulate. That's the magic of working with someone who operates on instinct.</p>

<h2>The Multilingual Approach</h2>

<p>One thing people notice about "Pepper Body" is the language switching. English, Pidgin, Spanish — all in one track. That wasn't a calculated move. That's just how I think. Growing up in Lagos, you switch between Yoruba, English, and Pidgin before breakfast. Moving to Austin added Spanish into the mix. When I write, I reach for whatever phrase carries the most emotion, regardless of language.</p>

<p>The Spanish ad-libs weren't planned. I was vibing in the studio, and they just came out. My engineer looked at me like, "Are we keeping that?" Yeah, we're keeping that. Music doesn't care about borders. Why should the lyrics?</p>

<h2>Road-Tested in East Africa</h2>

<p>Before we dropped "Pepper Body" officially, it got road-tested. And I don't mean I played it for my friends. I mean it got played in clubs across East Africa — Nairobi, Dar es Salaam, Kampala. DJs had early copies, and the response was immediate. People were making videos. People were creating dance challenges before we even had a release date.</p>

<p>That's when I knew we had something. You can manufacture hype, but you can't manufacture that feeling when a room of strangers moves together to your song. That's God's work, not mine.</p>

<blockquote>You can manufacture hype, but you can't manufacture that feeling when a room of strangers moves together to your song.</blockquote>

<h2>The Production</h2>

<p>I produced "Pepper Body" myself, which is something I do with most of my tracks. I play six instruments, so I tend to start with live elements and then build the electronic layer on top. The guitar riff you hear in the intro? That's me. The piano chords in the bridge? Also me. I layer live instrumentation with digital production because I want my music to feel human, even when it's banging at 130 BPM in a club.</p>

<p>The mix was tricky. I wanted it to sound massive but intimate at the same time. Like you're in a stadium but the artist is whispering in your ear. We went through maybe fifteen mix iterations before it felt right. Shoutout to every engineer who dealt with my obsessive notes.</p>

<h2>What "Pepper Body" Means</h2>

<p>"Pepper Body" is a celebration. It's about that person who walks into a room and changes the temperature. The one who doesn't try to get attention — they just have it. We all know someone like that. In Nigerian slang, "pepper" means you're showing off, you're hot, you're causing reactions. "Pepper Body" is that energy in human form.</p>

<p>But there's a deeper layer too. It's about confidence. About knowing who you are in a world that's constantly trying to define you. I wrote this from a place of self-assurance — not arrogance, just peace with who I am. Lagos-born, Austin-based, building AI by day and making Afrobeats by night. That's my pepper body.</p>
